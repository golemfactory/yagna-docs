# Quick launch on the New Network Driver

### Introduction

We have enabled providers and requestors to run their nodes with the New Network Driver. You are very welcome to try it out! Experimental Golem Network implementation provides better network scalability as well as increased performance with quicker responses and faster data transfers.

### Installation

#### Provider

Open your terminal and type:

```
curl -ksSf https://join.golem.network/as-provider | YA_INSTALLER_CORE=v0.11.0 YA_INSTALLER_VM=v0.2.13 bash -
```

for further details regarding simple Provider node setup please follow [Becoming a provider](https://handbook.golem.network/provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial#initial-setup) tutorial.

#### Requestor

Open your terminal and type:

```
curl -ksSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | YA_INSTALLER_CORE=v0.11.0 bash -
```

for further details regarding simple Requestor setup please follow [Requestor development](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development#confirm-the-installed-daemons-version) tutorial.

### Running the daemon

#### Provider

You can simply run Golem provider on the New Network Driver by typing the following in the terminal:

```
golemsp run
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important: Be aware that the default subnet for Provider running on the New Network Driver is `hybrid-mainnet`.
{% endhint %}

#### Requestor

You can start the daemon as you usually do:

```
yagna service run
```

After you launch the daemon, leave it running in the background. Remember to use `hybrid-mainnet` when running your tasks on Golem with the New Network Driver enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
This experimental Golem Network implementation is ready for your beta tests! In order to run your tasks on Golem devnet you can try to reach out to the `hybrid` subnet but please remember that we're still under optimization and our testnet might occasionally be unstable.
{% endhint %}

### Port forwarding

To help Golem Network grow and become more resilient and stable it needs more nodes with public IP addresses. This is helpful whether you are running a Provider or Requestor node. Golem can't automatically configure your router to open UDP port `11500`, therefore you will need to manually set it up. For router specific instructions on how to forward your ports go to [https://portforward.com/](https://portforward.com/). To check if your ports are forwarded correctly you can use [www.canyouseeme.org](http://www.canyouseeme.org/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If port forwarding doesn't work, you may need to call your ISP to change settings on your router. Don't worry if you are unable to acquire a public IP or open a port. This is optional and wonâ€™t prevent you from using the New Network Driver implementation.
