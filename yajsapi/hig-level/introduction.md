In order to make the journey through this tutorial easier to follow we divided it into sections.
The first one is a general introduction, pointing the developer's mind to the rails of Golem application development.

Next we explain the mechanics of task-based requestor development, with a simple example running on the VM runtime:

{% page-ref page="hello.md" %}

{% page-ref page="simple.md" %}

Then we proceed to complicate things a bit by showing you how to use Golem with a `hashcat` and show how we are going to make it work in parallel using Golem.

{% page-ref page="hashcat.md" %}

Last but not least, we describe how to use this api directly from the browser context.
