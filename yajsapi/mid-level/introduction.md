# Create your own task application using Mid-level API

## Introduction

Mid-level API allows for the development of intricate applications which satisfy the needs of each user and developer. Compared to High-level, it provides a greater range of options but users are expected to have an understanding of the fundamental principles and structure behind the Golem ecosystem.

## Building blocks

The basic components included in the Mid-level API are:

 - Package (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Allocation (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Accounts (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Demand (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Offer / Proposal (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Agreement (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Activity (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Script (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Command (TODO: link to API reference)
 - Invoice (TODO: link to API reference)
 - DebitNote (TODO: link to API reference)

In order for us better understand the functions of these various modules and how they connect with each other, let's look at two examples that demonstrate their practical application. This will help us comprehend the mechanics of operation and dependencies between individual parts.
{% content-ref url="./examples/hello.md" %}
[Task Example 0: Hello World!](./examples/hello.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="./examples/web.md" %}
[Task Example 1: Mid-level component in browser](./examples/web.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
