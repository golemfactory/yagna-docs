# Getting Started as a Requestor

****

{% hint style="info" %}
We have prepared a quick intro video if youâ€™d like to learn more about the SDK - click here [https://youtu.be/JuSXSDKXHoc](https://youtu.be/JuSXSDKXHoc)
{% endhint %}

## **What is the Golem SDK?**&#x20;

**Golem SDK is everything you need to interact with the Golem Network as a distributed app creator.**

**You can schedule tasks or deploy services using both Python and JS APIs, and you can build multi-layer applications with Golem dApps, all fueled with meaningful examples and comprehensive documentation.**&#x20;

To learn the top-level perspective about Golem SDK, please see the following Overview - [https://glm.zone/sdkoverview](https://glm.zone/sdkoverview)&#x20;

## **Where to start?**

Since our ecosystem is constantly changing, we have both stable and experimental ways of accessing our network

### Recommended

For a general introduction to Python/JS API usage, go to [https://glm.zone/jspython](https://glm.zone/jspython)&#x20;

Find out what Tasks are on Golem and how to schedule their computation [https://glm.zone/tasks](https://glm.zone/tasks)&#x20;

Discover what Services are on Golem and how to bring them to life [https://glm.zone/services](https://glm.zone/services)&#x20;

### Experimental

#### dApps on Golem

Golem dApps is a language-agnostic way of deploying multi-layer apps on the Golem Network.

You can give it a try by following the guide below:

[getting-started-with-dapps-on-golem.md](getting-started-with-dapps-on-golem.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also check the GitHub repositories:

* Golem dApp runner: [https://github.com/golemfactory/dapp-runner](https://github.com/golemfactory/dapp-runner)&#x20;
* Golem dApp examples: [https://github.com/golemfactory/dapp-experiments/tree/main/01\_todo\_app](https://github.com/golemfactory/dapp-experiments/tree/main/01\_todo\_app)

#### Golem Core Python

Golem Core Python is a new Python API that aims to provide more control over what is happening during interaction with the Golem Network. This is a great way for experienced Golem developers to adjust their market strategies or modify the interaction mechanisms with the network.

You can check it on our GitHub: [https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-core-python](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-core-python)
