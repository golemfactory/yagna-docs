In order to make the journey through this tutorial easier to follow, we divided it into sections. 

The first one is a general introduction, pointing the developer's mind to the rails of Golem application development.

Next we explain the mechanics of task-based requestor development, with a simple example running on the VM runtime:

{% page-ref page="task-example-0-hello.md" %}

Then we proceed to complicate things a bit by showing you how to use Golem with a simple hash-cracker:

{% page-ref page="task-example-1-cracker.md" %}

Last but not the least, we describe `hashcat` and show how we are going to make it work in parallel.

{% page-ref page="task-example-2-hashcat.md" %}

This is the main course of this tutorial. The implementation steps needed to create a full-fledged Golem application!
