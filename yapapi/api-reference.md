# API Reference

## yapapi

Golem Python API.

#### get\_version

```python
get_version() -> str
```

**Returns**:

the version of the yapapi library package

#### windows\_event\_loop\_fix

```python
windows_event_loop_fix()
```

Set up asyncio to use ProactorEventLoop implementation for new event loops on Windows.

This work-around is only needed for Python 3.6 and 3.7. With Python 3.8, `ProactorEventLoop` is already the default on Windows.

## yapapi.log

Utilities for logging computation events via the standard `logging` module.

Functions in this module fall into two categories:

* Functions that convert computation events generated by the `Executor.submit` method to calls to the standard Python `logging` module, using the loggers in the "yapapi" namespace \(e.g. `logging.getLogger("yapapi.executor")`\). These functions should be passed as `event_consumer` arguments to `Executor()`.
* Functions that perform configuration of the `logging` module itself. Since logging configuration is in general a responsibility of the code that uses `yapapi` as a library, we only provide the `enable_default_logger` function in this category, that enables logging to stderr with level `logging.INFO` and, optionally, to a given file with level `logging.DEBUG`.

### Functions for handling events

Several functions from this module can be passed as `event_consumer` callback to `yapapi.Executor()`.

For detailed, human-readable output use the `log_event` function:

```python
    Executor(..., event_consumer=yapapi.log.log_event)
```

For even more detailed, machine-readable output use `log_event_repr`:

```python
    Executor(..., event_consumer=yapapi.log.log_event_repr)
```

For summarized, human-readable output use `log_summary()`:

```python
    Executor(..., event_consumer=yapapi.log.log_summary())
```

Summary output can be combined with a detailed one by passing the detailed logger as an argument to `log_summary`:

```python
    Executor(
        ...
        event_consumer=yapapi.log.log_summary(yapapi.log.log_event_repr)
    )
```

#### enable\_default\_logger

```python
enable_default_logger(format_: str = "[%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s] %(message)s", log_file: Optional[str] = None, debug_activity_api: bool = False, debug_market_api: bool = False, debug_payment_api: bool = False)
```

Enable the default logger that logs messages to stderr with level `INFO`.

If `log_file` is specified, the logger with output messages with level `DEBUG` to the given file.

#### log\_event

```python
log_event(event: events.Event) -> None
```

Log an event in human-readable representation.

#### log\_event\_repr

```python
log_event_repr(event: events.Event) -> None
```

Log the result of calling `__repr__()` for the `event`.

### SummaryLogger Objects

```python
class SummaryLogger()
```

Aggregates information from computation events to provide a high-level summary.

The logger's `log()` method can be used as `event_consumer` callback to `Executor()`. It will aggregate the events generated by `Executor.submit()` and output some summary information.

The optional `wrapped_emitter` argument can be used for chaining event emitters: each event logged with `log()` is first passed to `wrapped_emitter`.

For example, with the following setup, each event emitted by `executor` will be logged by `log_event_repr`, and additionally, certain events will cause summary messages to be logged.

```python
    detailed_logger = log_event_repr
    summary_logger = SummaryLogger(wrapped_emitter=detailed_logger).log
    executor = Executor(..., event_consumer=summary_logger)
```

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
 | __init__(wrapped_emitter: Optional[Callable[[events.Event], None]] = None)
```

Create a SummaryLogger.

#### log

```python
 | log(event: events.Event) -> None
```

Register an event.

#### log\_summary

```python
log_summary(wrapped_emitter: Optional[Callable[[events.Event], None]] = None)
```

Output a summary of computation.

This is a utility function that creates a `SummaryLogger` instance wrapping an optional `wrapped_emitter` and returns its `log` method.

See the documentation of `SummaryLogger` for more information.

## yapapi.props

### NodeInfo Objects

```python
@dataclass
class NodeInfo(Model)
```

Properties describing the information regarding the node.

#### name

human-readable name of the Golem node

#### subnet\_tag

the name of the subnet within which the Demands and Offers are matched

### Activity Objects

```python
@dataclass()
class Activity(Model)
```

Activity-related Properties

#### cost\_cap

Sets a Hard cap on total cost of the Activity \(regardless of the usage vector or pricing function\). The Provider is entitled to 'kill' an Activity which exceeds the capped cost amount indicated by Requestor.

#### cost\_warning

Sets a Soft cap on total cost of the Activity \(regardless of the usage vector or pricing function\). When the cost\_warning amount is reached for the Activity, the Provider is expected to send a Debit Note to the Requestor, indicating the current amount due

#### timeout\_secs

A timeout value for batch computation \(eg. used for container-based batch processes\). This property allows to set the timeout to be applied by the Provider when running a batch computation: the Requestor expects the Activity to take no longer than the specified timeout value - which implies that eg. the golem.usage.duration\_sec counter shall not exceed the specified timeout value.

## yapapi.props.builder

### DemandBuilder Objects

```python
class DemandBuilder()
```

Builds a dictionary of properties and constraints from high-level models.

The dictionary represents a Demand object, which is later matched by the new Golem's market implementation against Offers coming from providers to find those providers who can satisfy the requestor's demand.

example usage:

```python
>>> import yapapi
>>> from yapapi import properties as yp
>>> from yapapi.props.builder import DemandBuilder
>>> from datetime import datetime, timezone
>>> builder = DemandBuilder()
>>> builder.add(yp.NodeInfo(name="a node", subnet_tag="testnet"))
>>> builder.add(yp.Activity(expiration=datetime.now(timezone.utc)))
>>> builder.__repr__
>>> print(builder)
{'properties':
    {'golem.node.id.name': 'a node',
     'golem.node.debug.subnet': 'testnet',
     'golem.srv.comp.expiration': 1601655628772},
 'constraints': []}
```

#### properties

```python
 | @property
 | properties() -> dict
```

List of properties for this demand.

#### constraints

```python
 | @property
 | constraints() -> str
```

List of constraints for this demand.

#### ensure

```python

```

Create a Demand on the market and subscribe to Offers that will match that Demand.

## yapapi.props.com

## yapapi.props.base

### InvalidPropertiesError Objects

```python

### Model Objects

```python
class Model(abc.ABC)
```

Provides helper methods to load the property model data from a dictionary and to get a mapping of all the keys available in the given model.

#### from\_properties

```python
 | @classmethod
 | from_properties(cls: Type[ME], props: Props) -> ME
```

Initialize the model from a dictionary representation.

When provided with a dictionary of properties, it will find the matching keys within it and fill the model fields with the values from the dictionary.

It ignores non-matching keys - i.e. doesn't require filtering of the properties' dictionary before the model is fed with the data. Thus, several models can be initialized from the same dictionary and all models will only load their own data.

#### keys

```python
 | @classmethod
 | keys(cls)
```

**Returns**:

a mapping between the model's field names and the property keys

example:

```python
>>> import dataclasses
>>> import typing
>>> from yapapi.properties.base import Model
>>> @dataclasses.dataclass
... class NodeInfo(Model):
...     name: typing.Optional[str] = \
...     dataclasses.field(default=None, metadata={"key": "golem.node.id.name"})
