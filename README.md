## REQUESTORS & DEVELOPERS

Looking for a quick start? [Dive into our requestor development primer!](requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development.md)

## PROVIDERS

Have a look at "[Becoming a provider](provider-tutorials/provider-tutorial.md)" if you're interested in running a provider node.

## What is Golem?

Golem is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combined computing power of the users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.

To facilitate that exchange, Golem implements a decentralized marketplace where IT resources are rented out. The actors in this decentralized network can assume one of the three non-exclusive roles:

* **Developer**

Has an idea to be executed. These ideas can be executed by requestors on provider nodes.

* **Provider**

Has free IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by Golem's decentralized infrastructure.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. In the requestors' case, it is also theoretically feasible for them to be executed on mobile devices.

## How can I benefit from Golem?

There are three ways to leverage the platform:

### **1. Develop a Golem-based product**

Our decentralized stacks offer a unique opportunity for software developers.

Ensuring that the development of products based on Golem is smooth and effortless is our core business.
{% endhint %}

**Plus, there are no licensing fees.**

To get up to speed on Golem application development, start with our [quick primer to requestor development](requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development.md) and follow up with the rest of our tutorials targeted at requestors.

### **2. Become a Golem provider**

To get set-up as a provider on the community subnet, follow our Provider tutorial and installation instructions. Our provider installation is set up to use the Ethereum mainnet by default, so once you launch it, you may start earning real GLM tokens right away.

### **3. Become a Golem requestor**

Even if you don't know how to develop tasks, you can still request them to be ran on a provider node. Just as developers, you can start with our [quick primer to requestor development](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development) to get a hang of requesting, and also check out [awesome-golem](https://github.com/golemfactory/awesome-golem#%EF%B8%8F-apps) to find more applications to use.

## Golem's mission - free, open-source, censorship-resistant, and democratized access to computing power for all:

{% hint style="info" %}
Golem is open-source software. All the code is available under the GPL license.
