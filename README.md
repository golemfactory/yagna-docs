## What is Golem?

Golem is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combined computing power of the users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.

To facilitate that exchange, Golem implements a decentralized marketplace where IT resources such as computation hardware are rented out. The actors in this decentralized network can assume one of the two non-exclusive roles:

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by Golem's decentralized infrastructure.

* **Provider**

Has free IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. In the requestors' case, it is also feasible for them to be executed on mobile devices.

## How can I benefit from Golem?

There are two ways to leverage the platform:

### **Develop a Golem-based product**

Our decentralized stacks offer a unique opportunity for software developers.

Ensuring that the development of products based on Golem is smooth and effortless is our core business.

**Plus, there are no licensing fees.**

### **Become a Golem provider**

One of the features we’re excited to share about New Golem, in comparison to Clay \(Legacy\) Golem is „no more port forwarding”.

To get set-up as a provider on the community subnet, follow our Provider tutorial and installation instructions. For this release, we have prepared a dedicated and controlled sub-network using Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet for payments. This means that the tokens received for the rental of your computing power will not hold any value outside of the network.

If you would like to earn real GLMs now, head over to our [Clay Golem Beta implementation](https://golem.network/products/clay-beta/) \(Legacy Golem\), which uses Ethereum mainnet.

## Golem's mission - free, open-source, censorship-resistant, and democratized access to computing power for all:

{% hint style="info" %}
Golem is open-source software. All the code is available under the GPL license.
